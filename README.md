Inspired by [Opta's Football Predictions](https://theanalyst.com/articles/opta-football-predictions) and [this](https://github.com/BelNaruto/English-Premier-League-API) api
The purpose of this app is to create a place where one can determine where they believe each team in a respective league will end up

Things I want to do:

- Track standings over a season
- Show minimal stats/info for each team
- Be mindful of leagues that experience relegation/promotions? Perhaps we ignore promotions initially and only focus on the top flight per country
- Create a "season simulation" based on collated responses
